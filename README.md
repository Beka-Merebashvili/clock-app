# Frontend Mentor - Clock app

![Design preview for the Clock app coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

 
## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this clock application and get it looking as close to the design as possible. You'll be using the following APIs to retrieve the necessary data:

- [World Time API](http://worldtimeapi.org/) to set the time based on the visitor's IP adress. This API will also be used for additional data, like the day of the year shown in the expanded state.
- [IP Geolocation API](https://freegeoip.app/) to set the city and country underneath the time
- [Programming Quotes API](https://programming-quotes-api.herokuapp.com/) to generate random programming quotes.
    - If the Programming Quotes API doesn't work, [here's a good alternative quote API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) you can use instead. It's not programming specific, but it will do the trick.
